## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom propertie
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt how important tab indexes are in your website allowing users be able use the website just with keyboard alone, learning how to make the the website interaction with the tab key and enter to perform the action. This discovery allowed me to be able to check how i can make that happen using javascript and placing tabindex in my html code to equip elements that don't naturally have this feature to have them.

I was also happy with the way i got to know how to manipulate svg elements using js.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:



### Continued development

i really want to focus on improving my tab indexing because i believe they can make my website hold more greater value
